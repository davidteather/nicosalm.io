title: Exploring Qiskit's Quantum Summer School 2023
description: My review of IBM Quantum's intensive two-week summer course.
---

QGSS 2023 (or the Qiskit Global Summer School - 2023 Edition) was a dynamic two-week course aiming to empower future quantum
researchers and developers. This year was it's fourth run, and it's primary foci were core concepts of
quantum computing, and bridging the gap between theory and real-world application.

I'm going to lay out my experiences, and explain why I think this is a vital opportunity for
those interested in the realm of quantum computing and quantum applications.
