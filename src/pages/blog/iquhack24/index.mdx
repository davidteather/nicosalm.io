First things first, a quick Public Service Announcement: ingesting 1400+ mg of caffeine is not recommended, even under the most dire of circumstances. Now, let's begin.

IQuHack is an annual quantum hackathon put on by QRISE and MIT and takes place on the MIT campus. 
Roughly 10 companies attend and propose big picture challenges to hackers (they don't reveal the details until the hacking period starts).
Participants then rank the challenges they want and are sorted accordingly. Each company ends up with a roughly equal number of teams competing.

We ranked Quandela's challenge highest. We hoped we could do some cool and novel things with QPINNs (quantum physics-informed neural networks). We got into Quandela's challenge but we weren't going to be able to do QPINNs after the specific prompt was revealed.

TODO: Finish this after I get over the fact that we couldn't use QPINNs.
